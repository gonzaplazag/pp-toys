# Write funny names

In this project, you'll write a simple python program, that generate nutty (mad) names by randomly combining surnames and names.

You'll also review best-practices coding guidelines and apply external programs that will help you to write code that conforms to this guidelines.

# Strategy

## Input

Two lists: first and last funny names.

## Definitions

We need only read from the list. We use a *tuple* as container.

## Pseudocode

- Load a list of first names
- Load a list of surnames
- Choose a first name at random
- Assign the name to a variable
- Choose a surname at random
- Assign the surname to a variable
- Print the names to the screen in order and in red font
- Ask the user to quit or playing again
    If user plays again:
        repeat
    If user quits:
        end and exit
